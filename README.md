# Jupyter Docker Pack

Based on/copy-pasted from:

 * https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks - taken `all-spark-notebook` and added `tensorflow` and `datascience` Dockerfiles' content, Ruby taken from open PR
 * https://github.com/saagie/jupyter-haskell-notebook - Haskell support
 * https://github.com/3Dcube/docker-jupyter-cling - C++ support

This image has no contribution from me, but since Docker do not allow combining layers and I wanted all-in-one package...
